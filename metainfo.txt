Name of Project : Ordered Pairwise Partitioning Algorithms

Published in : The Role of Rating Ordinality in Machine Learning Based Corporate Credit Models (Master Thesis, Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz Chair of Statistics, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin)

Description : 'The performances of various Ordered Pairwise Partitioning algorithm variants are compared to the performances of nominal classification algorithms and to the performance of the Ordinal Logistic Regression Model (Proportional Odds Model). For the analysis the models are applied to predict the number of abalone rings as a proxy of the age of the shellfish.'
